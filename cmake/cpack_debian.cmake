# This file contains CPack settings. Cmake will build a
# default build/CPackConfig.cmake. At the end it includes a
# properties file. You can override those default properties
# with these settings here. It is important that the top
# level CmakeLists.txt file set the CPACK_PROPERTIES_FILE to
# this file prior to including CPack.
